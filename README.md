# TWINE-A Lightweight Block Cipher for Multiple Platforms

This repository is an implementation of [TWINE: A Lightweight Block Cipher for Multiple Platforms](TWINE_A_Lightweight_Block_Cipher_for_Multiple_Platforms.pdf) paper introduced by Tomoyasu Suzaki, Kazuhiko Minematsu, Sumio Morioka, and Eita Kobayashi.

The codebase is running and working well, just needs to be refactored into an efficient library.
